## How To Play

You will have a zoo containing three different types of animals: monkeys, giraffes, and elephants.  
There will be five of each type of animal.   
Each animal has a health value held as a percentage (100% is completely healthy).   
Every animal starts at 100% health.  
The application should act as a simulator, with time passing at the rate of one hour every 20 seconds.   
Every hour that passes, the animals' health will decrease by a random value between 0 and 20 percent of their current health.  
You are able to feed the animals in the zoo.   
When this happens, each animal will be fed a random number of their favourite foods between 10 and 25, one for each type of animal.   
The health of the respective animals will then be increased by the specified percentage of their current health.  
If an elephant has a health below 70%, it cannot walk.   
If its health does not return to 70% or above once the subsequent hour has elapsed, it will die.   
When a monkey has a health below 30% or a giraffe below 50%, they will die straight away.  
You will be shown the status of the animals.   
The goal of the game is to keep them alive.   
The game ends when all animals are dead.
